# pid-line-follower-distance-detection
zigzag line follower with distance detection

The robot is programmed using micropython and the ev3 library for vs code 
along with the linux install with python compatibility for the ev3
heres the tutorial we used:
https://pybricks.com/projects/tutorials/dev/tools/vscode/



the testing track consists of a circle with a 40cm radius and an attachable on or off ramp,
the driving direction is counterclockwise
we went from trying to use a pid to just zigzagging as tests showwed it was measurably faster
(we went from upper 11 seconds for a full circle rotation to just under 8)
NOTE: the zigzag robot used a slightly different build as the original if anyone wants to build it they will have to go off the video supplied to modify the original


our team name is Sgh team 2 and we passed the qualifying rounds on the 2023.11.10(ISO-8601)
with a simple line follower using a brightness spectrum function
Following the qualifiers we passed the semi finals
and lost in the finals at 15th place utilising the same program we used for the qualifiers and just increasing the speed
as exams prevented us from spending more time optimising the robot
