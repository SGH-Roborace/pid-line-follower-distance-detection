# pid-line-follower-distance-detection
zigzag line follower with distance detection
the testing track consists of a circle with a 40cm radius and an attachable on or off ramp the driving direction is against that of a clock
we went from trying to use a pid to just zigzagging as tests showwed it was measurably faster (we went from upper 11 seconds for a full circle rotation to just under 8)
our team name is Sgh team 2 or sth like that and we passed the qualifying rounds on the 2023.11.10(ISO-8601) with a simple line follower using a brightness spectrum function
